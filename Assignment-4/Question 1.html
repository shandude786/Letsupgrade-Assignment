      there should be id attribute linked with corresponding html element.
      An ID must always be unique to the page,and therefore we will only ever be able to access 
      a single element at a time with the getElementById() method.

       The class attribute is used to access one or more specific elements in the DOM.

       This  getElementsByClassName() method return all the elements with a given class name 
        (a collection (an array) of HTML elements)
        Here , We can perform array operation and properties for manipulation.

      To access a single element, we will use the querySelector() method , on basis of argument .
      Argument would be Id or class name (with their access sign (id-># , class-> . ))linked with HTML element 
       querySelector() returns a single object with the first HTML element that matches the 'selectors'
