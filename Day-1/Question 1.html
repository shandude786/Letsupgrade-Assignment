There are 3 operands-> 1 , "2" , "2" and two same operator -> + (addition)
Addition operator gives arithmetic addition of two Numbers .
but it the same operator come in between  Number and string or String and String then it acts as concat operation.
So , here is only one operand as number and other two are String so concate operation would be done .
the result would be ->122*/

+"2" whole unit is another operand  which is Number type As Whenever + or - sign come  before string type would be change to Number  
and last "2" is also operand which is String type .
Now evaluate the expression from left to right ,
First two places have Number type (place one is 1 and second place is +"2") so 
evaluation would be 3 Now 
on simplification of statement would be 3+"2", here concate operation would be done 
so final result is ->32*/

so Whenever expression would be evaluate , 1 + (-1) gives 0 
Now on simplification it would convert into 0 + "2"
Here concate operation perform 
so final result would be ->02 */

      /*In above statement , all three operands are String type .but there is - (subtraction) operator between 
first two operands (from left to right ).
-  would only perform subtraction if , operands are Number type or they are coerced to numbers
But here , both cases are not possible because , these are not legal number and subtraction operation leads to NAN("Not-a-Number" value.).
So evaluation of first two operands would be NAN 
After that is String type operand and addition operator so concate operation would be perform as one operand is String type.
so final result would be ->NAN2 */

so , on evaluation of first two operands  would be NAN 
on simplification , expression would be NAN + 2 ,
addition operation would be perform if there would be two legal Number type operand but one is NAN 
so final result would be -> NAN*/
