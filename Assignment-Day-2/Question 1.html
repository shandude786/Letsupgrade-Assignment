      /* 
      Explanation:-
      First statement shows that there is an array of two element having length 2 
      And We have changed length of given array using length property So now length of given array is 0
      And on final statement we are trying to fetch first element of given array 
      So final result would be -> value of first element is "undefined "
      And There would be same value "undefined " for all element og given array because array having zero length means array does not contain any element now .
